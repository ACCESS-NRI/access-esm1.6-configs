abstract = {In sea ice models with multiple thickness categories the ice thickness distribution evolves in time. The evolution of the thickness distribution as ice grows and melts is analogous to one-dimensional fluid transport and can be treated by similar numerical methods. One such method, remapping, is applied here. Thickness categories are represented as Lagrangian grid cells whose boundaries are projected forward in time. The thickness distribution is approximated as a linear or quadratic polynomial in each displaced category, and ice area and volume are transferred between categories so as to restore the original boundaries. In simple test problems and in a single-column model with forcing typical of the central Arctic, remapping performs significantly better than methods previously used in sea ice models. It is less diffusive than a scheme that fixes the ice thickness in each category and behaves better numerically than a scheme that represents the thickness distribution as a set of delta functions. Also, remapping converges faster (i.e., with fewer thickness categories) than the alternative schemes. With five to seven categories the errors due to finite resolution of the thickness distribution are much smaller than the errors due to other sources. Linear remapping performs as well as the more complex quadratic version and is recommended for climate modeling. Its computational cost is minimal compared to other sea ice model components.},

	abstract = {Abstract. A better understanding of the role of sea ice for the changing climate of our planet is the central aim of the diagnostic Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6)-endorsed Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP). To reach this aim, SIMIP requests sea-ice-related variables from climate-model simulations that allow for a better understanding and, ultimately, improvement of biases and errors in sea-ice simulations with large-scale climate models. This then allows us to better understand to what degree CMIP6 model simulations relate to reality, thus improving our confidence in answering sea-ice-related questions based on these simulations. Furthermore, the SIMIP protocol provides a standard for sea-ice model output that will streamline and hence simplify the analysis of the simulated sea-ice evolution in research projects independent of CMIP. To reach its aims, SIMIP provides a structured list of model output that allows for an examination of the three main budgets that govern the evolution of sea ice, namely the heat budget, the momentum budget, and the mass budget. In this contribution, we explain the aims of SIMIP in more detail and outline how its design allows us to answer some of the most pressing questions that sea ice still poses to the international climate-research community.},

abstract = {The steady drift of pack ice in an idealized arctic basin has been calculated by assuming that the ice is incompressible and inviscid. The momentum and continuity equations for the ice are solved for the velocity and the ice pressure. The divergence of velocity is assumed to be 0.33×10−8 s−1. The boundary conditions require that no ice flows across coastal boundaries but that ice flows out of the basin into the Greenland Sea and into the basin from the Kara Sea. The patterns of calculated velocities and vorticities are realistic, but their magnitudes are too high. The maximum calculated ice pressure of about 108 dyn cm−1 (pressure integrated through the ice thickness) is marginally able to ridge thick ice, according to the ridging model of Parmerter and Coon (1973). These maximum values occur near Greenland, where Wittmann and Schule (1966) report intense ridging. When the wind stress is reduced to one third of the strength first assumed, realistic speeds and vorticities are obtained, and the maximum pressures are reduced to one third of the above value. Coastal shear zones of the order of 100 km wide can be represented by the added assumption of a shear viscosity of about 6×1012 g s−1 and a no-slip condition on coastal boundaries.},

              (ACCESS) has been extended to include land and ocean carbon cycle
              components to form an Earth System Model (ESM). The current
              version, ACCESS-ESM1.5, has been mainly developed to enable
              Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
              Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. Here we describe the
              model components and changes to the previous version,
              ACCESS-ESM1. We use the 500-year pre-industrial control run to
              highlight the stability of the physical climate and the carbon
              cycle. The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and
              small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC year−1
              for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of
              ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate
              system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and
              carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the
              CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and
              ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the
              climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the
              carbon simulation are improved. An assessment of the climate
              response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an
              equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.87°C.",
