	abstract = {Abstract. A better understanding of the role of sea ice for the changing climate of our planet is the central aim of the diagnostic Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6)-endorsed Sea-Ice Model Intercomparison Project (SIMIP). To reach this aim, SIMIP requests sea-ice-related variables from climate-model simulations that allow for a better understanding and, ultimately, improvement of biases and errors in sea-ice simulations with large-scale climate models. This then allows us to better understand to what degree CMIP6 model simulations relate to reality, thus improving our confidence in answering sea-ice-related questions based on these simulations. Furthermore, the SIMIP protocol provides a standard for sea-ice model output that will streamline and hence simplify the analysis of the simulated sea-ice evolution in research projects independent of CMIP. To reach its aims, SIMIP provides a structured list of model output that allows for an examination of the three main budgets that govern the evolution of sea ice, namely the heat budget, the momentum budget, and the mass budget. In this contribution, we explain the aims of SIMIP in more detail and outline how its design allows us to answer some of the most pressing questions that sea ice still poses to the international climate-research community.},

              (ACCESS) has been extended to include land and ocean carbon cycle
              components to form an Earth System Model (ESM). The current
              version, ACCESS-ESM1.5, has been mainly developed to enable
              Australia to participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison
              Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with an ESM version. Here we describe the
              model components and changes to the previous version,
              ACCESS-ESM1. We use the 500-year pre-industrial control run to
              highlight the stability of the physical climate and the carbon
              cycle. The long spin-up, negligible drift in temperature and
              small pre-industrial net carbon fluxes (0.02 and 0.08 PgC year−1
              for land and ocean respectively) highlight the suitability of
              ACCESS-ESM1.5 to explore modes of variability in the climate
              system and coupling to the carbon cycle. The physical climate and
              carbon cycle for the present day have been evaluated using the
              CMIP6 historical simulation by comparing against observations and
              ACCESS-ESM1. Although there is generally little change in the
              climate simulation from the earlier model, many aspects of the
              carbon simulation are improved. An assessment of the climate
              response to CO2 forcing indicates that ACCESS-ESM1.5 has an
              equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.87°C.",
